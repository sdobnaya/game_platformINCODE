## "IN CODE" platform game (JS/Canvas/OOP)


Hello, stranger. 
In this repository you can find a web game. IN CODE is its name. It's written in JS in the OOP paradigm and is rendered on canvas. To run the game you need to do the following:

1.  Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/sdobnaya/platformGame.git

2.  Install dependencies using:

        yarn

    or

        npm install

3.  Run webpack:

        npm start

Your canvas piece should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see 'HTML CANVAS BOILERPLATE' on hover.

Enjoy :)
